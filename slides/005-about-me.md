# About Me

- The gang

Note:
  My name is Chris Manson, you may recognise me online as the guy with the dog in his profile pic. That's rodney, who now has a friend Suzie and both of which are almost constantly tormented by my daughters Mary and Lexie.

I work for Mainmatter, a ever-growing web consultancy based in Europe. We used to be more of an Ember consultancy but now we do a whole bunch more. The project  that I'm working full time on is the Embroider Initiative (more about that later)

I really can't say how excited I am to be live on stage at EmberConf. Iâ€™ve been using Ember for 12 years now and this has been my dream. This is not my first talk that was accepted though
