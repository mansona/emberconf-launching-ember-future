# Launch Ember

- some launching ember thingy

Note:

There are plenty of things coming down the track with Ember, we've heard a bunch of them already and I'm sure there will be more in the following talks. The thing I'm focusing on is the build system and how we are translating the many emberisms of old into modern Javascript concepts, and more importnatly modern build systems.

I really want to focus on 3 things in this talk that I want you all to go away with a much stronger understanding of and hopefully a glimpse of the future that is just around the corner for us
