# Thing 2 - Rollup API

- dunce hat?

Note:

I’m going to use rollup as a model when talking about bundlers for two reasons. One I don’t know much about Webpack’s api right now

- reveal

And secondly rollup’s api is so good that it has become the defacto api for a lot of the other bundlers. Ultimately all APIs will just become the rollup api
