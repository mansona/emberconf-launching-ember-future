Note:

This is specifically designed to be kept up to date with CI telling us if we break anything and you can even use ember-cli-update to get any new changes that we make to the blueprint. In fact you will need to use ember-cli-update to keep up to date with all the changes since this blueprint literally installs the unstable versions of embroider that get shipped every time we merge to main.
