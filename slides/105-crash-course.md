# Crash course

This is a slide!

<script>
Reveal.on( 'slidechanged', event => {
  console.log(event)
  // event.previousSlide, event.currentSlide, event.indexh, event.indexv
} );
</script>

Note:

Rollup’s api is amazing but when I was getting into this work there does feel to be a conceptual gulf that nobody is filling with a “how to understand Rollup in 2 mins” so this is my challenge now!
