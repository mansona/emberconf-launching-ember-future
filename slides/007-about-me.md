![Mainmatter](/mainmatter.png)

Note:

I work for Mainmatter, a ever-growing web consultancy based in Europe. We used to be more of an Ember consultancy but now we do a whole bunch more. The project  that I'm working full time on is the Embroider Initiative (more about that later)

I really can't say how excited I am to be live on stage at EmberConf. Iâ€™ve been using Ember for 12 years now and this has been my dream. This is not my first talk that was accepted though
