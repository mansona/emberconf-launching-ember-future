Thing 1: What Embroider is doing
<!-- .element style="position: absolute; bottom: -100px; left: 0; font-size: 60%; color: grey;" -->

Note:

I wasn’t a part of the Embroider project at the beginning so I can’t comment on this from a historical perspective, but today Embroider can be summed up as a compatibility layer that is translating a bunch of emberisms into real ESM modules that a standard bundler can read and put together for you. There is of course a whole bunch of technicalities encoded in that last sentence but it’s a good enough mental model for now.
