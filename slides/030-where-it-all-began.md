Thing 1: What Embroider is doing
<!-- .element style="position: absolute; bottom: -100px; left: 0; font-size: 60%; color: grey;" -->

Note:

To understand what embroider is and what it's doing we have to start at the beginning

- slide pointing out the first ember-cli release

I wonder how many people in this room actually used ember before there was an ember-cli? (some remark on the size). well it may be hard to believe but before we went all in on ember-cli you could just add a script tag with ember in it to your html and things would start magically working

This was of course back before the Javascript community went all in on building everything so it was new and novel and scary. Ever since then ember-cli has been slowly iterating over **many** years adding a truly massive set of features and a very robust ecosystem  of addons that exercised each of those features. In weird and wonderful ways
