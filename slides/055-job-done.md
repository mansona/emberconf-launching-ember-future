Thing 1: What Embroider is doing
<!-- .element style="position: absolute; bottom: -100px; left: 0; font-size: 60%; color: grey;" -->

Note:

So that’s it, Ed writes embroider in 2019 and it translates your ember app for you and job done. Oh were it all so simple. For simple apps Embroider works perfectly. The app isn’t doing anything strange, it doesn’t have any strange dependencies with badly defined peer dependencies and it doesn’t use any ember addons that do anything strange with the build. 

But we are a community that values community solutions, when an addon becomes truly popular all of a sudden it could be installed by more than 20 or 30 percent of ember apps. And I can tell you now that there were a few very popular addons that were indeed doing very strange things with the build.
