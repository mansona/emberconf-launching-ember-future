# Build hooks and output hooks

![build](/rollup-build-hooks.png) <!-- .element style="max-height: 650px; margin-top: 150px;" --> 
![output](/rollup-output-hooks.png) <!-- .element style="max-height: 650px; margin-top: 150px;" --> 

Note:

Here is what the build hooks are and here is what the bundle hooks are. This is too complicated to understand so I’m going to just look at build hooks and more specifically I’m just going to look at the resolveId and the load hooks
