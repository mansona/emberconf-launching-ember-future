# Robots resolve the ID

```js
function mySuperPlugin(options) {
  return {
    name: 'my-super-plugin', 
		
    async resolveId(source, importer, options) {
      console.log(source === '@ember/application'); // true
      console.log(importer === '/path/to/your/repo/app/app.js'); // true
    }
  }
}
```

Note:

The resolveId hook in all your rollup plugins are called and each of them are given a chance to influence your build, and maybe change what this line means!

If the resolveId hook retuns nothing that plugin hasnâ€™t change anything, but you could if you wanted to return a different answer, essentially redirecting that import to somewhere else.
